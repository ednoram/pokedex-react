# PokÃ©dex

This is a React app that shows pokemons (API: pokeapi.co) in a list with some information about them.

## Features

- Pokemons are displayed in cards with their name, avatar and type.
- The list has a pagination with an ability to select the amount of cards to show per page (10 / 20 / 50).
- When you click on a pokemon in the list, a new page opens with the main pokemon stats and some other additional information about the pokemon.
- The pokemons can be filtered by name with a searchbox.
- The app is responsive (looks good on both mobile and desktop).
